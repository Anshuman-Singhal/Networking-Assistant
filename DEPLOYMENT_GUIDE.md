# NetworkingAI - Deployment & Configuration Guide

## 🚀 Application Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL

The NetworkingAI application is now fully functional and ready for use!

## ✅ Issue Resolution Summary

**Original Problem:** "Preview failed to load - Service is not responding after 5 attempts"

**Root Cause:** The `emergentintegrations` library was not properly installed, causing the backend service to fail on startup due to import errors.

**Solution Applied:**
1. ✅ Installed `emergentintegrations` library with correct index URL
2. ✅ Restarted all services to clear any cached errors
3. ✅ Verified all API endpoints are responding correctly
4. ✅ Confirmed frontend-backend integration is working
5. ✅ Tested full user workflows including contact creation

## 🔧 Configuration Required

### OpenAI API Key Setup (For AI Email Generation)

1. **Get Your API Key:**
   - Visit: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
   - Create a new API key

2. **Configure the Backend:**
   - Edit: `/app/backend/.env`
   - Replace: `OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE`
   - With: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key`

3. **Restart Backend:**
   ```bash
   sudo supervisorctl restart backend
   ```
